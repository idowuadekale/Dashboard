            <h2>Tip 1</h2>
            <p> <b>
                The point is to try to at least do a little Pratice, every day. Even when you don‚Äôt feel like it.
                <br> When I first started out, I had a calendar appointment set every single day, just for 25 minutes, to practice whatever book/course I was going through at the time.
                <br> Even if the thought of cracking open said book seemed like climbing Mount Everest and impossible to do -- I told myself ‚Äújust 25 minutes.‚Äù That‚Äôs it.
                <br> Think about it -- 25 minutes is only 5/288 of your day. Or 1.7% of your day. 1.7% !!!

                    We value things much more when we pay for them. 
                    <br>It‚Äôs great that there‚Äôs so much free stuff online. But the fact is, paid courses/tutorials are a lot better.
                    <br> Aside from their better quality, when you pay for something you have an incentive to follow through with it.
                    <br> The same exact thing applies to learning how to build a website or program an application. When you pay for a course, book, tutorial, etc. ‚Äî there is a much higher chance you will finish it. 
                    <br> (In fact, I‚Äôd argue that the more you pay, the more likely you will be to finish it.) Because you need to get your money‚Äôs worth, right? Exactly.
                    <br>So try paying for online courses because it helps in improving your knowledge

                    Join tech-based meetups in your area. Attend workshops or classes at said meetups or even through a local community college.
                   <br> Spending time with other people in the industry, whether it‚Äôs informally at a meetup or formally in a workshop, will help broaden your horizons.
                   <br> Finding a mentor is tough. Because you can‚Äôt just email someone and say, ‚Äú Oh hey. Mentor me? ‚Äù
                   <br> To this day, I don‚Äôt exactly have a single ‚Äúmentor‚Äù. But there are a handful of people, more experienced than me, that I talk to regularly. Some just through email. Others in person.
                   <br> Every ‚Äúmentor‚Äù has different experiences and pieces of knowledge to pass down. Some is related to coding, while others are more related to my career in general.
                   <br> Anyways, connecting with others more experienced than you is very, very useful. I‚Äôve learned so much from just a few people. 
                   <br> Simple things, even‚Äîlike awesome websites to visit and online courses to take.
                    <br> Also, you never know where you may meet a mentor.
